# About This Idea

## Why

Since 2022, China has been trying to "cool down" the education business, in the name of the "double reduction". As a result, business has been scrambling. ([News](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/05/chinas-harsh-education-crackdown-sends-parents-businesses-scrambling.html))

Often, families make huge lum sum payments to these schools to buy so-call class packages, in order to secure a better fee rate. Many companies have been running on these down payments as their lifeline and they could collapse even there is tiny turbulance; and many dishonest people even just aim at getting all these downpayment, and they would run away when it's possible. No matter what, families would suffer when these business folds. Not only families, but also the teachers are hurt, as they usually cannot get their salaries for months, before they realized that the company has been closed.

Is this the only to run such business? Do we, teaches or families, have to bear the risk of the platform default?

**I don't think so.**

### Hence, this is to provide a **reliable** and **trustworthy** platform to facilitate the very basic service exchange.

## What

### Let there be DAO.

A DAO-operated web3 platform.

## How

The platform should be managed by a DAO with full transparency through public votes, and consistency via pre-defined algorithms.
